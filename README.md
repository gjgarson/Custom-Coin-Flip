a small project i made a while ago to get back into java  
i lost the code for it but i thought it was neat so i quickly remade it

super simple, all it does is use scanner to get a custom number of sides on the coin (basically a die at this point)  
then creates an array of that size, loops through the array so you can name each side  
picks a random index in the array and prints to the console
